* Exercise 1
** Given:
a) The Auto dataset from the ISLR2 package \\
** Find:
a) use the lm() function to perform a simple linear regression with mpg as the
response and horesepower as the predictor. Use the summary() function to print
the results\\
    Is there a relationship between the predictor and the response? \\
    How strong is the relationship between the predictor and the response? \\
    Is the relationship between the predictor and teh respones positive or
negative

b) What is the predicted mpg associated with a horsepower of 98? \\
c) plot the response and the predictor. Use the abline() function to display the
least squares regression line \\
d) Use the plot() function to produce a diagnostic plots of the least squares
regression fit. Comment on any problems you see with the fit \\

Yes, there is a relationship between horsepower and mpg as shown by the adjusted
R-squared value of 0.6049 showing that ~60% of the varaince can be explained by
the model. The relationship between horesepower and mpg is negative as
demonstrated by the horesepower coefficent of -0.157 which shows that for each
unit increase in horsepower the mpg goes down by 0.1578 miles per gallon

  new_data = data.frame (horsepower = 98)

The predicted mpg associated with a horsepower of 98 is 24.5

The residuals vs fitted show a non-linear relationship. This was obvious in the
plotted results as well. Additionally the Scale-Location plot does not support
the equal variance assumption implying that there may be some
hederoscedasticity. However I would recomend reassessing this after a non-linear
model is applied. The normal quantile plot does support that the
residuals are normally distributed. There is a slight deviation in the ends but
not to the degree that would significantly impact the analisis. The Residuals vs
Leverage does not suggest that there are individual points that are leveraging
the resutls. \\

Overall, I would investigate a nonlinear fit (such as a logrithmic
transformation) due to the Residuals vs Fitted Plot.
